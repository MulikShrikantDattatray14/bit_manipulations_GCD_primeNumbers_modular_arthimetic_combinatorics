Given input  number(N). check if the N is prime  or not .

//A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. It has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.

if(N==1) return false;
for(let i=2;i<=Math.sqrt(N);i++){
    if(N%2==0)return false
}
return true;

Logic :-

if a  number is a prime number , it wont have a single factor in range[2,Math.sqrt(N)]
