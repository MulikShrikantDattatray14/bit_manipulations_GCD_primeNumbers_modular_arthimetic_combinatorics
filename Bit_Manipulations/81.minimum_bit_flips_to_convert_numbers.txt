Leetcode : 2220. Minimum Bit Flips to Convert Number-

A bit flip of a number x is choosing a bit in the binary representation of x and flipping it from either 0 to 1 or 1 to 0.

For example, for x = 7, the binary representation is 111 and we may choose any bit (including any leading zeros not shown) and flip it. We can flip the first bit from the right to get 110, flip the second bit from the right to get 101, flip the fifth bit from the right (a leading zero) to get 10111, etc.
Given two integers start and goal, return the minimum number of bit flips to convert start to goal.

 

Example 1:

Input: start = 10, goal = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The binary representation of 10 and 7 are 1010 and 0111 respectively. We can convert 10 to 7 in 3 steps:
- Flip the first bit from the right: 1010 -> 1011.
- Flip the third bit from the right: 1011 -> 1111.
- Flip the fourth bit from the right: 1111 -> 0111.
It can be shown we cannot convert 10 to 7 in less than 3 steps. Hence, we return 3.
Example 2:

Input: start = 3, goal = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: The binary representation of 3 and 4 are 011 and 100 respectively. We can convert 3 to 4 in 3 steps:
- Flip the first bit from the right: 011 -> 010.
- Flip the second bit from the right: 010 -> 000.
- Flip the third bit from the right: 000 -> 100.
It can be shown we cannot convert 3 to 4 in less than 3 steps. Hence, we return 3.
 

Constraints:

0 <= start, goal <= 109

The code aims to find the minimum number of bit flips required to convert the start number to the goal number. It uses the XOR operation to identify the differing bits between the two numbers. Let's break down the code and explain the approach:

let ans = start ^ goal;: This line calculates the bitwise XOR of start and goal. XOR returns a 1 if the corresponding bits are different and 0 if they are the same.

ans = ans.toString(2);: This line converts the XOR result to its binary representation as a string.

return ans;: The function then returns the binary representation of the XOR result.

result = Array.from(result);: This line converts the binary string into an array of characters.

let count = 0;: Initializes a variable count to keep track of the number of bits that need to be flipped.

for (let i = 0; i < result.length; i++) { if (result[i] == 1) count++; }: This loop iterates through the binary representation of the XOR result. For each bit that is '1', it increments the count variable.

console.log(count);: Finally, it prints the count, which represents the minimum number of bit flips required.

Here's an example using the provided values:

//================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

javascript
Copy code
const start = 10; // Binary representation of 10: 1010
const goal = 7;  // Binary representation of 7: 0111

// XOR operation: 1010 ^ 0111 = 1101
// Binary representation of XOR result: "1101"
// Number of bits to be flipped (count of '1's): 3
console.log(count); // Output: 3
So, in this example, the minimum number of bit flips required to convert 10 to 7 is 3.

function minBitFlips(start, goal) {
    // whereever there occurs a differnce in the bits change it . using the XOR
  let ans = start ^ goal;
  console.log(ans)
  ans = ans.toString(2);
  console.log(ans)
  return ans;
}

// Example usage:
const start = 10; // Binary representation of 10
const goal = 7; // Binary representation of 7

let result = minBitFlips(start, goal);
result = Array.from(result);
let count = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < result.length; i++) {
  if (result[i] == 1) count++;
}
console.log(count);
