Problem Description : 

You have an array A with N elements. We have two types of operation available on this array :
We can split an element B into two elements, C and D, such that B = C + D.
We can merge two elements, P and Q, to one element, R, such that R = P ^ Q i.e., XOR of P and Q.
You have to determine whether it is possible to convert array A to size 1, containing a single element equal to 0 after several splits and/or merge?

Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [9, 17]
Input 2:

 A = [1]


Example Output
Output 1:

 Yes
Output 2:

 No


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Following is one possible sequence of operations -  
 1) Merge i.e 9 XOR 17 = 24  
 2) Split 24 into two parts each of size 12  
 3) Merge i.e 12 XOR 12 = 0  
 As there is only 1 element i.e 0. So it is possible.
Explanation 2:

 There is no possible way to make it 0.

// logic : even number can be splited into 2 equal half and here resultant splited 2 numbers are the even numbers, whose XOR results into a zero. but odd numbers when splited will always give  one even number and one odd number. but if total number of odd number is even, then ans is possible, as addition of 2 odd number gives the even number and whose split will result into 2 even number , whose xor will be zero. 
  solve: function (A) {

        let countofodd = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
            if (A[i] % 2) {
                countofodd++;
            }
        }
        // checks the parity of the number of odd elements, if the odd element number is odd, then answer is "No" else "yes"
        if (countofodd % 2) {
            return "No";
        } else {
            return "Yes";
        }

    }
